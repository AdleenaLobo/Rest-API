## Running the API

You need Node and NPM installed for this.

1) Clone the repo
2) Run `npm install`
3) Run `nodemon ./app.js` in command prompt
4) All endpoints served at `localhost:3000` or the port specified in the config.

SQLite local database will auto generate in the repo folder. 

### If you have MySQL installed:
Edit the `config.js`, uncomment the commented part and vice versa. Change the database server credentials.
